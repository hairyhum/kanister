Experts who possess domain knowledge of a specific application&#39;s needs should be able to capture these needs when performing data operations on that application.</li><li><strong>API Driven:</strong> Data management tasks for each specific application may vary widely, and these tasks should be encapsulated by a well-defined API so as to provide a uniform data management experience. Each application expert can provide an application-specific pluggable implementation that satisfies this API, thus enabling a homogeneous data management experience of diverse and evolving data services.</li><li><strong>Extensible:</strong> Any data management solution capable of managing a diverse set of applications must be flexible enough to capture the needs of custom data services running in a variety of environments. Such flexibility can only be provided if the solution itself can easily be extended.</li></ol><h2 id="getting-started" tabindex="-1">Getting Started <a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Getting Started&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="./install.html">Installation</a> section to get section to get Kanister up and running on your Kubernetes cluster.
